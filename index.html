<!-- This tab talks about Volatility and what it is -->

<h2> What is volatility in trading? </h2>
<p id="volatility">Volatility is a statistical measure of the dispersion of 
returns for a given security or market index. In most cases, the higher the 
volatility, the riskier the security. Volatility is often measured from either
 the standard deviation or variance between returns from that same security 
 or market index. In the securities markets, volatility is often associated with 
 big swings in either direction. For example, when the stock market rises and falls 
 more than one percent over a sustained period of time, it is called a "volatile"
 market. An asset's volatility is a key factor when pricing options contracts.</p>

<h2 class="VolFactors"> Volatility Factors Include:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Political and Economic Factors</li>
  <li>Industry and Sector Factors</li>
  <li>Company Performance</li>
</ul>

        <ul>  
          <li>Market volatility brings increased opportunity to profit in a shorter amount of time</li>
          <li>Risk control measures—such as stop losses—gain in importance when markets are more volatile.</li>
          <li>Certain trading strategies involving shorter trading time frames have shown to work more effectively in volatile markets.</li>
        </ul>
      </td>
      <td>
        <ul>
          <li>First, volatility creates fear and uncertainty, which can lead to bad investment decisions</li>
          <li>While investors know in theory that they should “buy low, sell high,” in periods of extreme 
            volatility it is often the reverse. Too many investors see a big drop in the value of their portfolio 
            and sell to avoid further losses</li>
          <li>Volatility eats into your returns long term.</li>
        </ul>
